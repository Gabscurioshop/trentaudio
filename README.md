Welcome to Trentaudio!
A project by Carolyne Holmes, Gabrielle Curcio, Xuanyi Zhao

# Problem Statement
Currently, the audio and visual content on the [Trentoniana Library](https://trentonlib.org/trentoniana/audio-visual/) provides limited metadata and no transcriptions on certain content. Our project aims at expanding the versatility of the Trentonian Library and making it a better tool for research. 

# Objectives
* Create a clearer user interface that allows for better access to the data
* Create a database system that handles audio-based data
* Link audio files to their corresponding transcripts
* Allow upper-level users to submit possible meta-data for files (such as topics addressed in the file) or issues/errors found with the file
* Allow casual-level users (such as people not logged on) to view transcripts and listen to audio files (presented on the same page)
* Allow an administrator to edit meta-data or add/delete/edit files
